# Cardano House | RNC & DNC 2024 Policy & Education Centers
## *aka CryptoXNC*


Welcome to the official GitHub repository of the CryptoXNC project, a pioneering initiative aimed at bridging the gap between the blockchain community and the policymakers and politicians. 

The USA 2024 election cycle is the most important election of our lifetime. The USA has always been the epicenter of digital and internet technology. But this status is **at risk of changing for the worse**. It is neccessary that, through open dialogue and education, policymakers can understand the needs of innovators in the era of blockchain and decentralized technologies.

We believe the best place to have these conversations is during events at the 2024 Democratic National Committee (DNC) in Chicago, IL on Augist 18-22 and during the 2024 Republican National Committee (RNC) in Milwaukee, WI on July 15-19. 

During our events, we will curate high-impact educational environments and facilitate discussions between leaders and policymakers.

### Our Mission
To advance the understanding and beneficial applications of decentralized technologies and cryptocurrencies within public policy through dynamic dialogue and partnership between US policymakers and private industry leaders.
