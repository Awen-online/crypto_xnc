Welcome to the official GitHub repository of the Crypto XNC project, a pioneering initiative by Awen aimed at bridging the gap between the blockchain community and political engagement. The Crypto XNC project, with its dual facets—Crypto DNC and Crypto RNC—seeks to establish Policy & Education Centers for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Republican National Committee (RNC) respectively, with a focus on the 2024 electoral cycle.

### Project Overview
The Crypto XNC project is rooted in the belief that blockchain technology and the principles of decentralization hold significant potential for fostering transparency, accountability, and engagement within the political sphere. Our mission is to create spaces where political education and policy discussions can flourish, enhanced by the capabilities of the Cardano blockchain.

Our dedicated centers, Crypto DNC and Crypto RNC, will serve as hubs for policy development, education, and community engagement, aiming to empower citizens, policymakers, and activists with the knowledge and tools necessary for informed political participation.

### Repository Structure
This repository serves as the central hub for all project-related documentation, code, and resources. Here's what you can expect to find:

**Docs:** Project proposals, whitepapers, educational materials, and more.

**Events:** Information on upcoming workshops, seminars, and other events.

**Code:** Source code for any blockchain integrations, smart contracts, and other technological implementations.
