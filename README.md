# Cardano House | RNC & DNC 2024 Policy & Education Centers
## aka CryptoXNC


Welcome to the official GitHub repository of the CryptoXNC project, a pioneering initiative by Awen aimed at bridging the gap between the blockchain community and the policymakers and politicians. The CryptoXNC project, with its dual facets—Crypto DNC and Crypto RNC—seeks to establish Policy & Education Centers for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Republican National Committee (RNC) respectively, with a focus on the 2024 electoral cycle.

Our mission is to create spaces where political education and policy discussions can flourish, enhanced by the capabilities of the Cardano blockchain.
